Investigate the reflectance data collected by Morimoto et al. as part of their
2022 publication [“Spectral measurement of daylights and surface properties of
natural objects in Japan”](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-30-3-3183&id=468562"). The
dataset is made available at https://zenodo.org/record/5189606 with [Creative
Commons Attribution 4.0
Licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode). While the data
was published in 2022, the data was collected much earlier in 2013 and 2014.
